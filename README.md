## Introduction

This repository contains all information and documentation about Walter and
additional motherboards for Walter. Walter is a board designed by
[DPTechnics](https://www.dptechnics.com) which combines an
[ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3) and
a [Sequans Monarch 2](https://www.sequans.com/products/monarch-2-gm02sp) in a
small form factor IoT module. This gives Walter a vast amount of wireless
connectivity options such as:

- Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0
- 1T1R WiFi b/g/n
- LTE Cat-M1 (LTE-M)
- LTE Cat-NB1 (NB-IoT rel. 13)
- LTE Cat-NB2 (NB-IoT rel. 14), ready for rel. 15
- GNSS receiver (GPS and Galileo)

Besides these you get all the goodies from the ESP32-S3 chip such as  SPI, I2S,
I2C, PWM, RMT, ADC, UART, SD/MMC host and TWAI.

We design and manufacture Walter in Belgium and guarantee that the board will be
available for a minimum of 10 years. This makes Walter a solid choice to design
your next LPWAN IoT product with.

All documentation for Walter is open source and we welcome all contributions are
more than welcome.
