## Introduction

This guide will walk you through installing the Walter Modem library,
selecting the right board settings,
and running example sketches to get your modem up and running.

> [!TIP]
> If you haven't set up the Arduino IDE yet,
> go through [Arduino Setup Guide](/developer-toolchains/arduino.md) first.

## Guide

### 1. Installing the Walter Modem Library

The Walter modem library can be easily installed
via the built-in Arduino Library Manager:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Navigate to **Tools > Manage Librariesâ€¦**

### 3. Board Selection and Configuration

Before uploading your sketch,
ensure that your board is properly selected and configured:

1. Click the board selection button in the top left corner of the Arduino IDE.
2. In the search bar, type `DPTechnics Walter` and select the board.

3. Ensure the partition scheme under **Flash Size** is set to:
   (128Mb APP/12.5MB FATFS), this is required to allow mmodem firmware updates.

### 4. Running the Sketch

With the board configured and the example open:

1. Click the **Upload** button in the Arduino IDE.
2. Wait for the sketch to compile and upload to the board.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to view output
   and confirm that the modem connects to the internet.
