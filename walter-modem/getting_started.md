# Using ESP-IDF with the Walter Modem

## Introduction

> If you have already set up the ESP-IDF development environment and want to
> quickly start with Walter you can download our ESP-IDF library and run some
> examples. All source code is available on Github: 
> https://github.com/QuickSpot/walter-esp-idf

## vscode
> [!NOTE]
> vscode usage is recommended!
## Step 1: installing the ESP-IDF extension

> To start with vscode you will need the [ESP-IDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=espressif.esp-idf-extension) extension.
>
> After installing the extension you will be prompted to setup the extension.
>
> Select the latest ESP-IDF version and click install. \
> ![esp-idf-setup](../../img/esp-idf-setup.png)
>
> After that the extension will install all necessary tools required for using esp32 \
> ![esp-idf-install](../../img/esp-idf-install.png)

## step 2: Create a new project.

> To create a new project enter the following command in the vscode quikmenu:
> ```VSCODE
> >ESP-IDF:Create project from Extension Template
> ```
> And select the `template-app`.

> [!WARNING]
> When using the walter modem all implementation files (`.c`, `.cpp`) should have the `.cpp` extension.
> -> not `main.c` but `main.cpp`

## Step 3: Install the walter-modem ESP-IDF component.
> After installing the extension you will have to install the [walter modem](https://components.espressif.com/components/dptechnics/walter-modem/) library.

> [!WARNING]
> idf.py commands should pe passed down to the ESP-IDF terminal. \
> ```VSCODE
> >ESP-IDF: Open ESP-IDF Terminal
> ```

>Execute the following command in the ESP-IDF terminal:
>```ESP-IDF terminal
>idf.py add-dependency "dptechnics/walter-modem^1.1.3"
>```

> [!NOTE]
> viewing the component registry cann be done using the following command:
> 
>```VSCODE
> >ESP-IDF: Show ESP Component Registry
>```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use youre own `fork` or use the `DEV` version of waltermodem, you can use the following snippet inside ´idf_component.yml´
>
> ```yml
> dependencies:
>  dptechnics/walter-modem:
>    version: "*"
>    git: "https://github.com/QuickSpot/walter-esp-idf.git"
> ```


## Step 4: Setting the Device Target.
after installing the walter modem extension the Device Target needs to be set to esp32s3 (this needs to be done for each project)
>vscode quikmenu command:

## **Micropython**

# Using MicroPython with the Walter board

## Introduction

[MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) is a lightweight implementation of the Python programming language that is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments. This tutorial will guide you through setting up MicroPython on Walter, running your first script, and using the [Walter MicroPython library](https://github.com/QuickSpot/walter-micropython).

## Step 1: Install Python and required tools

### Python

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Windows**

Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation, ensure you select the option to add Python to your PATH.

#### **Linux: Debian-based**

Most Debian-based systems come with Python pre-installed. Verify by running:

```shell
python3 --version
```

If not installed, install it with:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
```

#### **Linux: Fedora**

Fedora normally comes with Python pre-installed, to verify this, run:

```shell
python3 --version
```

If Python is not installed on your system, you can install it like so:

```shell
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

### Python virtual environment

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Windows**

Open a terminal window in your project directory.

- *Open "Terminal" and navigate to the project directory `cd path/to/your/project/dir`*
- *Alternatively, navigate to your project directory in File Explorer, then right-click in the empty space and select "Open in Terminal."*

Create a virtual environment:

```shell
python -m venv micropython-env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```shell
micropython-env\Scripts\activate
```

> [!NOTE]
> In PowerShell, the activation command would be:
>
> ```ps
> .\micropython-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
> ```

#### **Linux: Debian-based**

Install the `venv` module if it's not already installed:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

Create a virtual environment inside your project directory:

```shell
python3 -m venv micropython-env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```shell
source micropython-env/bin/activate
```

#### **Linux: Fedora**

In Fedora, Python 3 includes the built-in venv module.

Create a virtual environment inside your project directory:

```shell
python3 -m venv micropython-env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```shell
source micropython-env/bin/activate
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

*Your terminal prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active.*

### ESPTool

[esptool](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32s3/index.html) is a Python-based tool that helps you flash the MicroPython firmware onto the ESP32-S3 SoC of your Walter board. Within the virtual environment, install esptool using pip:

```shell
pip install esptool
```

## Step 2: Download MicroPython firmware

### Download the MicroPython firmware

Visit the [MicroPython ESP32-S3 download page](https://micropython.org/download/ESP32_GENERIC_S3/) and download the latest stable **.bin** firmware release for the ESP32-S3.

### Identify the correct COM port

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Windows**

Connect your Walter to your computer via USB. Identify the COM port by opening Device Manager and checking under "Ports (COM & LPT)". The port will be labeled something like `COM3` or `COM4`.

#### **Linux: Debian-based**

Connect your ESP32-S3 to your computer via USB and identify the port by running:

```shell
ls /dev/ttyACM*
```

#### **Linux: Fedora**

Connect your ESP32-S3 to your computer via USB and identify the port by running:

```shell
ls /dev/ttyACM*
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

The port will look something like `/dev/ttyACM0`, remember the port for the following steps.

## Step 3: Flash MicroPython onto the ESP32-S3

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Windows**

1. **Erase the flash** Run the following command, replacing `<your_port>` with your identifed port from the previous step:

   ```shell
   esptool --chip esp32s3 --port <your_port> erase_flash
   ```

2. **Flash the firmware** Use esptool to flash the MicroPython firmware onto the ESP32-S3. Replace `<your_port>` and `<firmware_path>` with your port and the path to the downloaded firmware:
  
   ```shell
   esptool --chip esp32s3 --port <your_port> write_flash -z 0 <firmware_path>
   ```

### **Linux: Debian-based**

1. **Erase the flash** Run the following command, replacing `<your_port>` with your identifed port from the previous step:

   ```shell
   esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port <your_port> erase_flash
   ```

2. **Flash the firmware** Use esptool to flash the MicroPython firmware onto the ESP32-S3. Replace `<your_port>` and `<firmware_path>` with your port and the path to the downloaded firmware:

   ```shell
   esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port <your_port> write_flash -z 0 <firmware_path>
   ```

### **Linux: Fedora**

1. **Erase the flash** Run the following command, replacing `<your_port>` with your identifed port from the previous step:

   ```shell
   esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port <your_port> erase_flash
   ```

2. **Flash the firmware** Use esptool to flash the MicroPython firmware onto the ESP32-S3. Replace `<your_port>` and `<firmware_path>` with your port and the path to the downloaded firmware:

   ```shell
   esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port <your_port> write_flash -z 0 <firmware_path>
   ```

<!-- tabs:end -->

## Step 4: Access the MicroPython REPL

The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive prompt that allows you to run Python commands directly on the ESP32-S3.

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Windows**

1. **Install PuTTY**: Download and install PuTTY from the [official website](https://www.putty.org/).

2. **Open PuTTY**:
   - Set the connection type to `Serial`.
   - Enter your COM port (e.g., `COM3`) and set the speed to `115200`.
   - Click "Open" to start the session.

3. **Access the REPL**: Press the `Enter` key. You should see the MicroPython prompt (`>>>`). Try typing the following in the prompt:

   ```python
   >>> print('Hello Walter!')
   Hello Walter!
   ```

### **Linux: Debian-based**

1. **Install picocom**: If you don't have picocom installed, install it using:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install picocom
   ```

2. **Open a serial terminal**: Open picocom with the following command:

   ```shell
   picocom -b 115200 <your_port>
   ```

3. **Access the REPL**: Press the `Enter` key. You should see the MicroPython prompt (`>>>`). Try typing the following in the prompt:

   ```python
   >>> print('Hello Walter!')
   Hello Walter!
   ```

### **Linux: Fedora**

1. **Install picocom**: If you don't have picocom installed, install it using:

   ```shell
   sudo dnf install picocom
   ```

2. **Open a serial terminal**: Open picocom with the following command:

   ```shell
   picocom -b 115200 <your_port>
   ```

3. **Access the REPL**: Press the `Enter` key. You should see the MicroPython prompt (`>>>`). Try typing the following in the prompt:

   ```python
   >>> print('Hello Walter!')
   Hello Walter!
   ```
<!-- tabs:end -->

## Step 5: Writing and running your first MicroPython script

You can write and test simple scripts directly in the REPL, such as the following Hello World example:

1. **Hello World**: This simple script will print `Hello World` followed by a random int between 0 and 10 every second. Enter the following code in the REPL:

   ```python
   from time import sleep
   from random import randint
   
   while True:
       print("Hello World - %d" % randint(0, 10))
       sleep(1)
   ```

2. **Stopping the Script**: To stop the script, press `Ctrl+C`. In order to restart the script, reboot Walter by pressing `Ctrl+D`.

## Step 6: Uploading scripts via Thonny

Uploading files to a Walter running MicroPython lets you deploy full scripts that are saved to the device’s filesystem, making them persistent and ready to run even after a reboot. Several tools are available, such as [Thonny](https://thonny.org/), [ampy](https://github.com/scientifichackers/ampy) and [rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell). Thonny is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed for Python. It also supports MicroPython, making it a popular choice for uploading scripts to a MicroPython device.

### Install Thonny

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Windows**

Download and install Thonny from the [official website](https://thonny.org/).

#### **Linux: Debian-based**

Install Thonny using the following command:

```shell
sudo apt-get install thonny
```

#### **Linux: Fedora**

Install Thonny using the following command:

```shell
sudo dnf install thonny
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

### Connect Thonny to ESP32-S3

- Open Thonny and go to `Tools` > `Options` > `Interpreter`.
- Set the interpreter to `MicroPython (ESP32)`.
- Set the port to `< Try to detect port automatically >`.

### Write and upload scripts

- Write your MicroPython script in the editor.
- Click the `Run current script` button to run the script on Walter.

## Step 7: Using the Walter MicroPython library

1. **Clone the Walter MicroPython library**:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/QuickSpot/walter-micropython.git
   ```

2. **Open the repository in Thonny**:

   - Open Thonny and ensure that the MicroPython interpreter is set up correctly (as done in Step 6).
   - Go to `File` -> `Open...`.
   - Navigate to the local directory where you cloned the repository.

3. **Upload all files to Walter**:

   - Upload the `boot.py`, `queue.py`, `walter.py` and `_walter.py` file by right clicking on each file and selecting `Upload to /`, if this option is not availble, click on: `File` -> `Save as...`, and select `MicroPython device`.  Now, the library is uploaded to Walter and the uploaded `boot.py` script will run on every restart.

You can find some example applications for Walter in the `examples` folder.

The Walter MicroPython library currently features four files:

- `boot.py` initially contains an example application for Walter, but can be modified to contain your own application.
- `queue.py` is a third-party `Queue` implementation that is missing in `uasyncio`, MicroPython's `asyncio` implementation. The code is cherry-picked [from this great repo by Peter Hinch](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-async).
- `walter.py` contains the library implementation for interacting with Walter.
- `_walter.py` contains extra constants and helper objects for the library.

The library makes use of asyncio coroutines for communicating with the modem, queueing commands and running your user code. You can create your own coroutines, for example to wait for a GNSS fix in the background (instead of blocking the main coroutine).  Extra tasks in your main routine can be created as following:

```python
import uasyncio
import walter
import _walter

async def my_extra_task():
    # ...

async def main():
    # ...
    # ......
    uasyncio.create_task(my_extra_task())
    # ......
    # ...

modem = walter.Modem()
modem.begin(main)
```
